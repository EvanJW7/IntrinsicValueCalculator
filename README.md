# Stock-Price-Intrinsic-Value-Calculator
This program calculates the intrinsic value of a list of stocks using data from various financial websites and displays a buy, sell, or hold recommendation as well as a scatterplot for better visualization. Stocks are entered by the user and program is run on-demand. The basic idea is to calculate the total operating cash flow expected over a period of 12 years taking growth into account, then divide that number by number of shares outstanding, add cash per share and expected 12 year total dividend, and subtract debt per share. 

Here is a sample screen from 1/21/22.
