# Stock-Price-Intrinsic-Value-Calculator
This program calculates the intrinsic value of a list of stocks using data from various financial websites and gives a buy, sell, or hold recommendation as well as a scatterplot for better visualization.
The idea behind the program is that is uses it's future expected growth to calculate expected operating cash flows over the next 10 years and divides that sum by the total number of shares outstanding for each stock. Then the cash per share and the expected dividend is added to the intrinsic share price and the debt per share is subtracted to get a final expected intrinsic value estimate.
Here is a sample screen from 1/21/22.
