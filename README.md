# Stock-Price-Intrinsic-Value-Calculator
This program calculates the intrinsic value of a list of stocks using data from various financial websites and gives a buy, sell, or hold recommendation as well as a scatterplot for better visualization. Stocks are entered by the user and program is run on-demand. The basic idea is to calculate the total operating cash flows expected over a period of 10 years taking growth into account, then dividing that number by total number of shares outstanding and then adding cash per share and expected 10 year total dividend and subtracting debt per share. 

Here is a sample screen from 1/21/22.
